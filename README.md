This project implements the game of Tic Tac Toe.
User can pass inputs to the program using the testbench and the algorithm will calculate the state of the game.
Inputs from 2 players have to alternate just like in the game.
The game is completed when either player A or player B has won. The game is tied when neither A nor B has won and there are no cells left to fill. The game continues when none of the former states are true.
